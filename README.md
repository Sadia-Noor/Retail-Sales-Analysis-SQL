# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis using SQL

🚀 **Retail-Sales-Analysis-SQL** is a structured SQL project designed to analyze retail sales data. It includes data cleaning, exploration, and business insights to help derive meaningful trends from sales transactions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales transactions using SQL. The dataset contains customer information, sales details, product categories, and financial data such as price and cost of goods sold. Queries are structured for:

- **Data Cleaning** (Handling NULL values, filtering invalid records)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Sales trends, customer insights, peak sales hours)
- **Business Insights** (Profit analysis, best-selling products, customer segmentation)

## 📑 SQL Queries Breakdown

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE total_sale IS NULL;
DELETE FROM retail_sales WHERE age IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales 
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY category;
```

### 🔹 Customer Insights & Sales Trends
```sql
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS total_sales, SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue 
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY gender 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 🔹 Time-Based Analysis (Sales Trends)
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year, 
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month, 
       SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue 
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY year, month 
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### 🔹 Profit & Business Impact
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(cogs) AS total_cogs, 
       SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue, 
       (SUM(total_sale) - SUM(cogs)) AS profit 
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY profit DESC;
```
